Some custom css scripts for sites to make them nicer.

### Roam
This is pretty wide ranging, mainly it changes the colour pallet, fonts, and has a host of conditional highlighting for things 
like people and books

### Google docs
Gets rid of page breaks so document looks like it is infinite page.

### Twitter
removes entire right hand side so you don't have trending news, follow suggestions etc. Also removes some icons from the left menu 
I never used. Honestly getting rid of trending news is the best upgrade to my twitter experience. One thing to note is that this is
made for the 'Dim' setting, if you are on a different setting you will currently see an empty box on the right hand side. 

### Stylus
I use stylus for my twitter and google doc themes.
* Install stylus (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne)
* Under "Actions" click "write a new style"
* Paste in the css in this repo
* At the bottom of the page put the settings to "URLs starting with" and then "https://twitter.com/"
* Save 

For Roam the css is in [[roam/css]] as this makes it work on my phone as well.
